# Clean + Riverpod Template (V2)

This folder contains deliverables for the new company template strategy:

1. `member_app_template`: business app repository scaffold (Clean Architecture + Riverpod).
2. `mobile_core_sdk`: reusable core plugin repository scaffold (independent Git + versioned packages).
3. `core_network` token refresh interceptor draft with tests.

The scaffolds are intentionally minimal but runnable as a starting point for migration from the legacy GetX codebase.

## Tooling baseline

- Flutter: `3.35.1`
- Dart: `3.9.0`
- Version manager: `fvm`

Use `fvm` prefix for all Flutter/Dart commands in both repos.
