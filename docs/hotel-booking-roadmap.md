# Hotel Booking Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-06-16

This document defines the working plan for the upcoming hotel booking feature. It should be read before opening task threads related to hotel list, hotel detail, room selection, booking, payment, or hotel orders.

## Current Status

Existing code:

- `fundex/lib/features/hotel_booking/presentation/pages/hotel_booking_tab_page.dart`
- `mobile_core_sdk/packages/company_api_runtime/lib/src/hotel/hotel_api_client.dart`
- `mobile_core_sdk/packages/company_api_runtime/lib/src/hotel/hotel_dtos.dart`
- `mobile_core_sdk/packages/company_api_runtime/test/hotel_api_client_test.dart`

Current behavior:

- Hotel page is wired as the fourth bottom tab at `/hotel-booking`; Profile remains as the fifth bottom tab.
- Hotel tab implements the first home/list/search slice using the SDK `HotelApiClient`.
- Hotel browsing is public. The current booking action still uses `memberProfileActionGuardProvider.ensureCompleted(...)` until the real booking flow is implemented.
- Hotel home hero temporarily reuses the same remote banner image URL pattern as the home tab.
- Hotel home and hotel detail are immersive with transparent status bars and content extending to the top edge. Other hotel child pages, including orders, profile, confirmation, and result pages, use the default app status bar.
- Hotel API requests include fixed app metadata headers from the app network layer: `x-client-type: Stellavia-App` and `app-version` from `PackageInfo.version`.
- After login, app startup and app-language changes sync the current hotel language to authenticated `/pms/setUserLang?lang=...` so hotel backend response messages follow the active locale. The sync is skipped while logged out. The language codes use the existing hotel mapping: Japanese `JP`, English `EN`, and Chinese `CH`.
- Hotel home shows quick actions above the search filter controls: stay benefits, hotel orders, frequent guests, coupons, and contact. Stay benefits opens `/hotel-booking/stay-benefits`, which reuses the filter/sort/map toolbar, `/hotel/hotelSearch` list API with `stayBenefit: true`, the public `/hotel/homePage/stayBenefitPeriods` date-period API, and home hotel cards with normal price display. The stay-benefit list uses `stayBenefitParticipate` from each hotel row to replace the remaining-room line with a muted "no stay benefit for current date" status when the selected date is not eligible. The older hotel-specific member profile route `/hotel-booking/member-profile`, backed by `/pms/member/info` and `/pms/member/custSetInfo`, remains implemented but is not currently linked from the hotel home quick-action row. Hotel orders opens `/hotel-booking/orders`, frequent guests opens `/hotel-booking/contacts` backed by `/pms/member/memberContactsList`, saves add/edit changes through `/pms/member/memberContactsSaveOrUpdate`, and deletes contacts through `/pms/member/memberContactsDelete`; coupons opens `/hotel-booking/coupons`, and contact opens the existing contact form.
- App settings now includes a credit-card list entry under bank account settings. The list page calls `/creditCard/register/list` and opens a separate fullscreen add page at `/profile/settings/credit-card/add`; the add page validates card data through Veritrans `/4gtoken`, then registers through `/creditCard/register`. The Veritrans token API key is injected through `VERITRANS_TOKEN_API_KEY` rather than committed in code.
- Hotel list search uses fixed area choices only: all areas as `area: ""`, plus `osaka`, `kyoto`, and `tokyo`. Building/property type choices come from `/hotel/buildingCode`, including the empty-code "all" option returned by the API. `/hotel/hotelSearch` requests include `stayBenefit`, defaulting to `false` for normal hotel browsing and set to `true` for the stay-benefits list.
- Hotel home paginates `/hotel/hotelSearch` with 9 rows per page. Pulling near the bottom automatically requests the next `startPage`, appends rows, and stops when the loaded count reaches the API `count`.
- Stay-benefit date selection consumes `/hotel/homePage/stayBenefitPeriods`, highlights eligible check-in dates in the shared calendar with the warning/gold theme, and enforces a single-night range: tapping an eligible date selects that date as check-in and the following date as check-out. The sheet displays the guidance text that stay benefits support only one night.
- Entering the stay-benefits list no longer requests `/pms/my/fundBenefitTickets` while that endpoint is temporarily disabled in the app layer; stay-benefit ticket amount is treated as unavailable for now.
- Hotel home shows selected search conditions as a compact summary bar; tapping the summary bar or search icon opens the full four-row search condition sheet over the tab bar. The sheet edits a local draft and refreshes the list only after "Check availability". Hotel date picking uses the shared custom range calendar across home/search and detail; home/search shows date cells without prices, while detail injects `/pms/priceByDate` prices into the same calendar.
- Hotel list cards navigate to the public detail route `/hotel-booking/:id` with the current search criteria.
- Hotel remaining inventory labels distinguish room-based properties from whole-building properties. Aparthotel/room booking displays room units, while townhouse/machiya/villa/whole-property booking displays building units. The list/map cards use summary `buildingType`, `buildingCode`, and `bookingType` as fallbacks; detail cards use the detail booking type.
- Hotel discount badges can open a discount-detail dialog backed by `POST /hotel/homePage/priceDiscount` with the current stay dates, language, and hotel id. On the main hotel list, the dialog includes a booking action that navigates to hotel detail with the current criteria; other discount-badge entry points show details only.
- Hotel detail has a first UI/data slice: hero gallery, stay summary, room-plan selection, detail sections, refund policy text, and sticky booking amount bar. Booking submit is still a placeholder action.
- Entering hotel detail triggers the legacy-compatible detail request set: `/pms/hotelinfobyidapp`, `/pms/refundStrategyText`, and `/pms/priceByDate`, plus the public `/hotel/homePage/stayBenefitPeriod` request with the current `hotelId` to load that hotel's supported stay-benefit dates. Detail-page use of those dates is still pending.
- In the stay-benefit flow, hotel detail now evaluates stay-benefit ticket usability before booking: the selected check-in date must be supported by `/hotel/homePage/stayBenefitPeriod`, stay length must be exactly one night, room count must be one, the member must hold an unused fund stay-benefit ticket, and the highest unused ticket `benefitAmount` must be greater than or equal to the current reference booking amount. Insufficient amount means the ticket cannot be used at all and cannot be partially applied. When the stay-benefit rules fail, the detail page shows the reason and the bottom action continues as regular booking only after confirmation.
- Hotel detail stay-date and guest changes follow the legacy detail-page behavior: date or adult/child changes reload the detail data and reset selected room-plan quantities and assigned occupancy price; the detail guest popup does not edit the search room-count field. The detail stay-date calendar uses the already-loaded `/pms/priceByDate` map to show each day's price under the day number while selecting the check-in/check-out range. In the custom calendar, tapping a date while a full range is selected resets that date as the new check-in only; tapping a later date after a check-in-only state completes the range, while tapping the same or an earlier date resets the check-in.
- Hotel detail shows `checkInMessage` as a yellow notice card above the room list when it is non-empty. Do not display request/assign `message` values there.
- Hotel detail room quantity changes call `/pms/assign/occupancy` only for `bookingType == 0` room/room-type booking and use the returned assigned price for the booking amount before entering confirmation. Total selected room quantity is capped by the current adult count; when the assign response returns positive `extraGuestCount`, the room card shows the extra guest count and `extraGuestPrice` above the quantity stepper. Non-room-selection bookings such as whole-property booking do not require room quantity selection.
- Tapping the hotel detail booking button re-runs `/pms/assign/occupancy` for `bookingType == 0`; if the response contains `message`, show it in a cancel/confirm dialog and continue to confirmation only after confirm. For non-room-selection bookings, `checkInMessage` is used as the confirmation notice before entering the confirmation page.
- Tapping a room plan card opens a room-detail bottom sheet with room photos, facts, facility categories, and room description from the detail API room-type fields.
- Hotel booking confirmation has a first UI/data slice at `/hotel-booking/:id/confirm`: order summary, coupon entry row, payment method selection, booker form, guest form, invoice, note, and sticky amount bar. For `bookingType == 0`, selected room quantities are expanded into one guest form per actual room and `/pms/bookingorder/save/v2` receives one `roomCusts` entry per room. Room guest forms are grouped in one section card under a single title, with each room number/name shown above its fields; room guest name and nationality/region are required, room guest email is optional, and room guest forms do not collect phone numbers. The first room guest defaults to using the booker information through a checked shortcut checkbox, which can be unchecked for independent editing. Booker and editable room guest forms can open the saved frequent-guest contact picker, add/edit contacts, refresh the contact list, and fill the current form from the selected contact. For non-room-selection bookings, confirmation shows one whole-property guest form. Booker email remains required.
- Entering hotel booking confirmation initializes the legacy-compatible preparation request set: `/pms/page` for `APP011`, `APP003`, `APP004`, and `APP012`, plus `/pms/countryCodeList`, extra-person quote, `/pms/coupons/order/custListV2`, `/pms/member/memberContactsList`, and `/creditCard/register/list`. `bookingType == 0` uses `/pms/order/room/extraPerson` with `roomTypeCustNums`; non-room-selection bookings use `/pms/order/extraPerson` with `orderRoomTypeData` and `customerCount`.
- In the stay-benefit confirmation flow, `/pms/my/fundBenefitTickets` is temporarily not requested, so the page does not auto-select a stay-benefit ticket and continues with the regular payable amount unless a ticket is restored through a future flow.
- Hotel booking confirmation coupon selection uses `/pms/coupons/order/custListV2` for ordinary coupons. The stay-benefit ticket request `/pms/my/fundBenefitTickets` is temporarily disabled in the app layer, so stay-benefit tickets are not loaded into the picker for now. Selecting or clearing an ordinary coupon re-quotes through the booking-type-specific extra-person endpoint with `couponsCounts`, and the selected coupon is passed into `/pms/bookingorder/save/v2`. Guest count changes also re-quote through the same endpoint without inserting/removing in-list loading UI, so scroll position is preserved. The confirmation summary card shows selected room types as left-aligned room rows with right-aligned quantities, then a separate payable-amount section; when a coupon or stay-benefit ticket changes the payable amount, show the original price as a strikethrough beside the payable amount, but do not show member-registration discount UI for now. Adult and child counters are independently limited by room-type `adults` and `kids` from the detail API instead of sharing one total occupancy cap; when `kids` is missing or `0`, the child counter uses the adult limit. When the returned `roomPriceElements.priceTip` is non-empty, show that text in red above the corresponding room guest counter, right-aligned and without an extra container.
- Hotel booking confirmation auto-fills empty booker fields from the current App authenticated user cache. Booker name uses App `lastName`/`firstName` first and falls back to `lastNameEn`/`firstNameEn`; email, phone, and phone country code use the authenticated user fields.
- Successful hotel pre-order creation navigates to `/hotel-booking/:id/result` with the order id, selected payment method, payable amount, and a notice that payment is still required within the backend timeout window. Any payment action now opens `/hotel-booking/payment`, a redesigned payment-method selection page that defaults to the order's submitted payment method but lets the user choose again before paying. The credit-card payment path supports both registered cards and adding a card during payment: registered cards load `/creditCard/register/list` and pay through `/creditCard/member/cardIdPay`; new-card payment tokenizes through Veritrans, then uses `/creditCard/payAndAuth` when the user does not save the card or `/creditCard/member/payAndJoin` when the user saves it. All credit-card payment paths open the returned 3D Secure URL in the shared web viewer and treat URLs containing `paysuccess` / `payfailed` as payment completion signals. The visible payment options are currently credit card and standby balance only. Standby balance display and insufficiency checks use the App account statistic `withdrawableAmount` derived from `firstLevelAccountTotal - lockedFee`; the actual hotel standby-balance payment still pays through `/pms/pay4order` with `paymentCode: "10"`. WeChat payment calls `/pms/pay4order` with `paymentCode: "14"`; Alipay payment does not use `/pms/pay4order` and instead calls `/ali/app/pay` with `id` and `system` (`android`, `iphone`, or `ipad`), but both native options are temporarily hidden until platform and merchant configuration is complete. Native paths launch payment through Flutter plugins, call `/pms/optimismPayment` after the native result, and refresh hotel order list/detail state. The Alipay native Flutter plugin is currently not linked because its bundled iOS framework is device-only and breaks simulator builds; keep the backend Alipay order path modeled, and restore a simulator-compatible SDK/XCFramework or a true device-only integration when real-device Alipay validation resumes. The static WeChat plugin config in `fundex/pubspec.yaml` still contains placeholder values and must be replaced with merchant-console values before real device payment validation.
- Hotel order list is available from the hotel home quick-action row at `/hotel-booking/orders`. It calls `/pms/order/list` with top status filters for all, awaiting payment, booked, and cancelled orders, loads 5 rows per page, and keeps list state in a Riverpod controller.
- Hotel today check-in list is available from the hotel home quick-action row at `/hotel-booking/check-in`. Entering the page refreshes `/pms/page` for `APP007`, `APP003`, and `APP008`, then calls authenticated `GET /pms/order/todayCheckIn?lang=...` and renders the returned bookings in the app's hotel order-card style. Tapping a booking opens the dedicated check-in detail page backed by `POST /pms/order/detail`; the detail check-in action confirms with a common dialog, submits `POST /pms/book/cust/checked` with `bookingOrderId` and `checkedIn: 1`, surfaces backend failure messages such as before-time rejection, and refreshes the detail/list providers after success.
- Hotel coupon list is available from the hotel home quick-action row at `/hotel-booking/coupons`. It loads `APP011` page text for legacy type-2 coupon labels and calls `/pms/coupons/custListV2` with the current hotel language code. The previous "My fund stay benefit" ticket segment is not active while `/pms/my/fundBenefitTickets` requests are disabled.
- Hotel order detail is available at `/hotel-booking/orders/:orderId`. Entering the page loads `/pms/order/detail` plus `/pms/page` for `APP008`, `APP003`, and `APP0011`, maps the legacy detail fields into typed domain data, and renders the first redesigned order-detail UI slice. Its more menu includes a receipt action that opens a bottom sheet prefilled from `receiptTitle` and `contactEmail`, then requests `/pms/order/invoice` and surfaces backend messages with the shared app toast.
- SDK-level hotel API client/DTO foundation exists for the first migration slice.

Current gaps:

- Native Alipay/WeChat real-device merchant validation is still pending because the configured app ids, schemes, universal links, Android package/signature, and merchant-console settings are not available yet. Alipay native SDK linkage also needs a simulator-safe package or explicit device-only reintroduction before final validation.
- No refund or cancel policy flow.
- Hotel API success-code contract is still unresolved: old app checks `code == 200`, while current architecture notes say hotel uses `code == 0`.

## API And Legacy Reference Sources

Hotel booking is a migration-and-redesign effort, not a greenfield feature.

Primary API reference:

- Swagger UI: `https://hotel-sit.gutingjun.com/api/swagger-ui/index.html#/`
- OpenAPI JSON: `https://hotel-sit.gutingjun.com/api/v3/api-docs`

Legacy functional references:

- API path source: `/Users/aaronhou/Documents/financing-flutter-getx/lib/app/config/http_conf.dart`
- Legacy feature source: `/Users/aaronhou/Documents/financing-flutter-getx/lib/app/modules/hotel`

Reference scope:

- Use Swagger to understand hotel API paths, request/response fields, and schemas.
- Use the old hotel module to understand what the existing app already supports: list, detail, room selection, calendar price, booking, payment, order list/detail, cancellation/refund, contacts, receipts, coupons, member discount, and credit-card flows.
- Do not copy the old project architecture, GetX state model, route structure, untyped map parsing, or page implementation style.
- New implementation must follow this app's Clean Architecture + Riverpod + SDK-client strategy.
- New UI should be redesigned for StellaVia/current app style; do not preserve old UI layouts unless the user explicitly asks.

Migration principle:

1. First bind API paths and data fields to Swagger.
2. Use the old app only to fill behavior/flow gaps not covered by Swagger.
3. Then model them as typed SDK DTOs and app domain entities.
4. Then rebuild the UI and page state with current app architecture.

## Product Goal

Add a hotel booking module that can coexist with the existing fund investment app without breaking investment, wallet, profile, settings, or discussion flows.

The hotel module should reuse existing app infrastructure:

- Auth state and route guard.
- Member profile completion guard.
- Shared UI kit components and tokens.
- Network clusters and envelope parsing.
- Image/PDF/web/video helpers if relevant.
- Wallet/payment primitives only when the final hotel payment model requires them.

## Suggested User Flow

Initial minimum viable flow:

1. Hotel tab / entry page.
2. Hotel search or list.
3. Hotel detail.
4. Room plan selection.
5. Booking date/guest input.
6. Booking confirmation.
7. Booking result.
8. Booking list.
9. Booking detail.
10. Cancel flow if backend supports it.

Later optional flow:

- Coupon/benefit usage.
- Campaign display.
- Favorites/history.
- Review or comments.
- Map/directions.
- Hotel document/PDF display.

```

## API Strategy

Current primary source is the hotel Swagger/OpenAPI:

- Swagger UI: `https://hotel-sit.gutingjun.com/api/swagger-ui/index.html#/`
- OpenAPI JSON: `https://hotel-sit.gutingjun.com/api/v3/api-docs`

The old app's `http_conf.dart` hotel section is now a legacy compatibility/reference source only.

Before implementing hotel API calls, confirm:

- Base cluster: `AppApiCluster.hotel` or another configured cluster.
- Swagger/OpenAPI operation and schema.
- Envelope success code. Existing architecture notes say Hotel uses `code == 0`.
- Pagination structure.
- Auth requirement per endpoint.
- Date format and timezone handling.
- Price fields and currency semantics.
- Booking state enum values.
- Cancellation policy fields.
- Payment model: wallet, external payment, offline settlement, or mixed.

Current SDK implementation note:

- `HotelApiClient` currently accepts both `code == 0` and `code == 200` because the legacy app checks `200` while the new architecture notes mention `0`.
- This compatibility is temporary. Tighten the success profile once the authoritative hotel API contract is confirmed.
- Implemented Swagger-backed methods: `/hotel/hotelSearch`, `/hotel/homePage/stayBenefitPeriods`, `/hotel/homePage/stayBenefitPeriod`, `/pms/hotelinfobyidapp`, `/booking/order` Airhost booking creation, `/booking/order/sendPaymentLink`, and `/pms/pay4order`.
- Swagger currently emits several request schema property keys as Chinese labels while placing the real wire field name in `example` values, for example `房源档案ID` -> `hotelInfoID` and `预订平台ID` -> `siteID`. The SDK DTOs use the wire field names observed from these examples and the legacy request payloads.
- Implemented legacy-compatible methods pending Swagger confirmation or replacement: building code, room facility filters, refund strategy text, price calendar, assign occupancy, booking confirmation page text/country/coupon/contact/card preparation, hotel member info/update, booking create v2, order list/detail, member pay info, cancel rule, and cancel order.
- Hotel DTOs are generated with `freezed_annotation` / `json_serializable`; do not add hand-written model parsing functions for new hotel DTOs unless the backend returns dynamic-key rows such as `/hotel/homePage/stayBenefitPeriods`.

If Swagger is incomplete:

- Use the old app `http_conf.dart`, old module request payloads, and real request/response examples as temporary sources only when Swagger lacks the needed contract.
- Mark temporary assumptions in code comments near API path/client definitions.
- Update this roadmap once backend contract is confirmed.

Environment/base-url notes from the old project:

- Production base was commented as `https://hotel.gutingjun.com/api/`.
- SIT base was `https://hotel-sit.gutingjun.com/api/`.
- Share URL was based on `/hoteldetail?id=`.
- Credit-card public key and token API key existed in the old app; do not hardcode them in the new app. Wire them through environment config/secrets if this flow is migrated.

## Data Model Draft

Initial entities likely needed:

- `HotelSummary`
  - id, name, location, coverImageUrl, tags, lowestPrice, rating, availability status.
- `HotelDetail`
  - id, name, description, address, images, facilities, policies, check-in/out time, room plans.
- `RoomPlan`
  - id, hotelId, roomName, planName, capacity, mealType, images, price, remainingRooms, cancellationPolicy.
- `HotelBookingDraft`
  - hotelId, roomPlanId, checkInDate, checkOutDate, guestCount, guestName/contact, note.
- `HotelBookingOrder`
  - id, orderNo, hotelName, roomPlanName, stay dates, guest count, amount, status, payment status, cancel policy.

Keep DTOs separate from entities. Do not expose backend field names directly to UI if a presenter/display model is needed.

## UI Strategy

- Do not keep the placeholder `Card/ListTile` visual style for final hotel pages.
- Reuse `core_ui_kit` primitives but define a hotel-specific visual language if needed.
- Hotel pages must use theme/token colors, not hardcoded `Color(0x...)`, `Colors.*`, or page-local hex constants.
- Shared reusable hotel cards should move to SDK only when they are not product-specific.
- Keep page files focused on composition and provider/event binding. Put non-trivial child UI in separate files under `presentation/widgets/`, and put display mapping/formatting in `presentation/support`.
- All user text must be in ARB.
- Images should use existing cached image approach to avoid placeholder flicker.
- Root tab content should support pull-to-refresh and should avoid clearing old content on transient network failure.

## Guarding Rules

Use existing guards instead of creating hotel-specific duplicated checks:

- Browsing hotel list/detail can be public unless product decides otherwise.
- Creating a booking should require login.
- Confirming a booking should require member profile completion if legally or operationally required.
- If phone/identity verification is required, use current centralized providers/guards. Remember phone verification means `/member/login/index` `phone` is non-empty only.

## Task Breakdown

Recommended task threads:

1. Hotel API contract discovery
   - Start from hotel Swagger/OpenAPI.
   - Use old `http_conf.dart` hotel endpoint keys and old module requests only for behavior gaps or missing Swagger contracts.
   - Produce endpoint list, request payloads, response samples, and field mapping.
   - Update this roadmap.

2. SDK hotel client skeleton
   - Done for the first API slice.
   - Continue refining with real response samples and confirmed success codes.

3. App domain/data vertical slice
   - Add entities, repository, remote datasource, usecases, providers.
   - Keep remote datasource thin over SDK client.

4. Hotel list tab replacement
   - Done for first slice.
   - Current home search summary includes destination, date range, stay nights, adults, children, and room count.
   - Full search condition sheet fields are destination, building type, date range, adults, children, and room count.
   - Pull-to-refresh preserves old content on refresh failure.

5. Hotel detail page
   - First slice done: route, detail data, image gallery, room-plan selection UI, refund policy text, and bottom amount bar.
   - Remaining: date/guest edit from detail page, map entry, image preview, and final visual tuning after real response variety is confirmed.

6. Room plan and booking draft
   - Date/guest selection, validation, draft state.

7. Booking confirmation and submit
   - Submit API, confirmation UI, result UI.

8. Booking list/detail
   - User order list and order detail.

9. Cancel/refund/payment integration
   - Only after backend payment/cancel contract is confirmed.

10. Polish and localization
   - Final copy, all locales, edge states, accessibility, tests.

## Validation Defaults

For a hotel task thread, prefer targeted validation first:

```bash
cd /Users/aaronhou/Documents/GitHub/HanjouFinace/fundex
rtk fvm flutter gen-l10n
rtk fvm flutter analyze <touched dart files>
rtk fvm flutter test <specific test file>
```

For SDK client work:

```bash
cd /Users/aaronhou/Documents/GitHub/HanjouFinace/mobile_core_sdk/packages/company_api_runtime
rtk fvm flutter test test/<new_or_changed_test>.dart
rtk fvm flutter analyze lib/src/hotel test/<new_or_changed_test>.dart
```

Run broader `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` only when the change affects shared infrastructure or before release.

## Open Questions

- Is hotel browsing public or login-only?
- Does booking require full member profile completion, phone verification, real-person verification, or all of them?
- What payment method is used for hotel booking?
- Are hotel orders connected to wallet/account history?
- Are hotel benefits related to owner/fund benefits or a separate product domain?
